                        <h1>Japanese Mini Pig</h1>
                        The Japanese Mini Pig, also known as Micro-Pig, is renowned for its unusually small, yet cute
                        appearance that is capable of capturing many peoples' hearts. It is the most popular breed of pig 
                        to keep as pets, as they do not need much space to comfortably live in and do not require
                        large amounts of food compared to other pigs. In fact, they are so popular to the point that 
                        there are cafes built around Micro-Pigs, for enthusiasts to play and eat with. They are 
                        also known to be very affectionate towards their owners, seeking to spend time with them.

                        <h1>Yorkshire Pig</h1>
                        Most commonly found in farms, it boasts a rapid growth rate and high quality meat production.
                        Complimenting its already fast reproduction rate, most farmers choose to raise these large pigs
                        for cost-efficient measures. Do not underestimate it however, as some people overlook it for its
                        quality and instead keep them as pets. Although their huge size might be a small issue, you can 
                        overlook that if you are a mega pig enthusiast.

                          <h1>Hampshire Pig</h1>
                          The Hampshire Pig is best known by its striking black body with a white
                          belt around its shoulders and front legs. Known for its muscular build and rapid
                          growth rate, the Hampshire is also favorite among farmers for producing high-quality, lean meat.
                          Originally from England and later refined in the United States, this breed is celebrated 
                          not just for its productivity, but also for its hardiness and calm temperament. Its strong
                          genetics and excellent foraging abilities 
                          make it a valuable choice for both small farms and large-scale operations.

                          <h1>Vietnamese Pot-bellied Pig</h1>
                          The Vietnamese Pot-Bellied Pig is a small domestic breed known for its distinct low-slung belly,
                           short legs, and charming personality. Originally bred in Southeast Asia, it quickly gained 
                           popularity around the world as a unique companion animal. Their intelligence 
                           and surprising cleanliness make them ideal pets for those seeking something a little out of the
                          ordinary. While they do require structure and space due to their size, pot-bellied pigs are affectionate, social 
                          creatures that can form strong bonds with their ownersâ€”often becoming just as beloved as dogs 
                          or cats in the household.

                          <h1>Duroc</h1>
                         Duroc pigs are easily recognized by their reddish-brown coats and muscular build, making them one of 
                         the most popular pig breeds in the world. Known for their excellent growth rate and high-quality 
                         meat, they are commonly raised for commercial pork production. Durocs are not only hardy and 
                         adaptable to various climates, but also gentle in nature, which makes them easier to manage.
                         Their strong genetics contribute to lean meat with good marbling, which is highly valued in the
                          industry. These pigs are a favorite among farmers for both their efficiency and temperament.
